Contains 2 examples:

1. Standard Logit
    - Shows off Pluto.jl workflow (like Jupyter, but harder to mess up)

2. Random Coef multinomial logit w/ 3 choices for balanced panel
    - Shows off package development / Revise.jl-based workflow
    - Better to edit with an IDE like VS Code or Atom
    - Would be cool to parallelize
